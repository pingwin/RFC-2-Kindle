Description:

This is for anyone who has a kindle and are frustrated with the options for reading IETF RFC documents on the Kindle. 

This is by far a perfect script, but it should be a good start for most documents thus far.

TODO:
 * Section Links
 * Smarter Title Finding
 * Cleaner header display

Packages Required:

* ImageMagick
* KindleGen (http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000234621)


Execution:
./rfctxt2kindlehtml.py -i rfc1034.txt -o rfc1034.html && ./kindlegen rfc1034.html



Update:

I haven't owned a kindle in a few years. So I haven't been maintaining this project. I'll happily accept pull requests, however I have no way of testing any fixes. 

Fell free to fork and enjoy :)
